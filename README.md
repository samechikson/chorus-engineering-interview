## Prompt

Lets make a Pokémon Team builder!

We want to create a way to select 6 Pokémon to be on our team.

The UI should allow the user to:

1. View a list of the first 150 Pokémon
2. Select from the list of Pokémon
3. Submit the Pokémon that we have selected to the backend.

**It does not have to be a beautiful UX experience. We're aiming for functional.**

### Completion Criteria

Database Requirements

- There should be a Profile table
- There should be a Pokémon table
- There should be a relationship between Pokémon and Profiles.

UI Requirements

- Show a list of the first 150 Pokémon
- Show selectable Profiles
- Select a profile, and choose up to 6 Pokémon.

API Requirements

- Return pokemon
- Create Profiles
- Handle receiving Pokémon related to Profiles

## Submission Criteria

All of your work should be located in a Github Repo.

Ensure your repo is public, and submit the URL back to the hiring manager.

### Troubleshooting

> I can't execute pm2!

pm2 is part of the devDependencies, so when you install the dependencies, you should be able to
execute the binary from node_modules.

Either use `pnpm pm2` or add `node_modules/.bin` to your `PATH`.

> The requirements are confusing. I'm stuck.

Contact the hiring manager, and inform them of the situation. Be specific and clear about your concerns or issues.
